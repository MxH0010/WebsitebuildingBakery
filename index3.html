<h2>Why’s it Called Devil’s Food Cake?</h2>
    <p>
        
I absolutely love knowing the history behind recipes and their names, so naturally I had to investigate the origins of Devil’s Food Cake and share with you!

So here’s the deal: Devil’s Food Cake rose in popularity in the 1900’s. A time when it was very normal to give desserts dramatic names! Many believe the name was inspired by the cakes slightly red hue and sinfully decadent nature. Although it’s certainly a lot less devilishly red than red velvet cake! It’s more an orangey red from the cocoa powder.

One of the few solid facts available is that in 1902, the recipe was published for the first time in an American cookbook called Mrs. Rorer’s New Cookbook.

The recipe was developed by Sarah Tyson Rorer’s and it quickly spread across the country, becoming staple dessert in many households. And the rest, as they say, is history!
