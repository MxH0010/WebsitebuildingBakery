<h2>Why’s it Called Devil’s Food Cake?</h2>
    <p>
        
I absolutely love knowing the history behind recipes and their names, so naturally I had to investigate the origins of Devil’s Food Cake and share with you!

So here’s the deal: Devil’s Food Cake rose in popularity in the 1900’s. A time when it was very normal to give desserts dramatic names! Many believe the name was inspired by the cakes slightly red hue and sinfully decadent nature. Although it’s certainly a lot less devilishly red than red velvet cake! It’s more an orangey red from the cocoa powder.

One of the few solid facts available is that in 1902, the recipe was published for the first time in an American cookbook called Mrs. Rorer’s New Cookbook.

The recipe was developed by Sarah Tyson Rorer’s and it quickly spread across the country, becoming staple dessert in many households. And the rest, as they say, is history!

    Instructions

 <h6>
For the Devil’s Food Cake:</h6>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees (F). Spray two 9-inch round baking pans with non-stick baking pray. Line the bottom of each pan with a round of parchment paper. Then spray the parchment paper with non-stick baking spray. Set aside. 
<li>
    In a large bowl sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. 
    <li>
       In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl using a handheld electric mixer, beat the butter at medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. 
   <li>
    Gradually add in both sugars, one at a time, and beat until the sugar has been incorporated into the butter. Then increase the speed to high and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. You may need to stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl once in a while to ensure no butter is getting stuck. 
    <li>
        Add in the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition, and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add in the vanilla extract and beat until combined. 
        <li>
            In a spouted measuring cup, combine the oil and sour cream. 
            <li>
                On the lowest speed setting available, add the flour in three additions, alternating with the sour cream mixture, in two addition, beating until just combined! You should still see the lightest trail of dry ingredients when you stop the mixer. 
                <li>
                Pour in the hot coffee and let the mixture sit, undisturbed, for 30 seconds. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently stir until the batter is just evenly combined. 
                <li>
                    Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans (around 850 grams per pan) and smooth the tops with a rubber spatula. 
               <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for 38 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs attached. 
                <li>
                    Place the cakes, in the pans, on a wire rack and cool for 20 minutes. Then invert the cakes onto the rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour.

    For the Chocolate Frosting
</h6>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
             Finely chop the chocolate using a large chef’s knife. Place the chopped chocolate into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. 
             <li>
                In a small saucepan heat the cream and corn syrup over medium-high heat until the mixture comes just short of a rolling boil. Remove the pan from heat and pour over the chopped chocolate.
                <li>
                    Allow the mixture to sit, undisturbed, for 2 minutes. Then, using a rubber spatula or metal spoon, gently stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth and glossy. Stir in the vanilla.

                    <li>
                       With the mixer on medium-speed, add in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition, and not adding more until the first addition has been completely incorporated into the frosting. Beat in the salt. 
                       <li>
                        Refrigerate the frosting, loosely covered, for about 1 hour, or until it’s firm enough to spread. Frosting may be made up to 24 hours in advance and stored, covered, in the fridge. You’ll need to let it come to room temperature before using.

                Using a long, serrated knife, slice off the domed top of each cake layer so it is smooth and even. Then slice each cake in half horizontally, so that you have 4 even layers. Set all of the cake scraps aside, we’ll use those later to decorate! 
                <li>
                    Place one cake layer on a large plate or cake stand. Spread 1/2 cup of the frosting on top of the cake, covering it completely. Then top with another cake layer, and repeat the layering process, ending with the last cake layer on top. Spread all remaining frosting  over the top and sides of the cake. 
                    <li>
                        Spread all remaining frosting  over the top and sides of the cake. 
Using your hands, crumble up the remaining cake scraps until they’re in fine crumbs. Pat the crumbs gently around the sides of the cake. You might have leftovers, which you may discard or enjoy as a snack!

    Allow the cake to set for 20 minutes before slicing. Then serve, or store, in the refrigerator, for up to 5 days. Bring to room temperature before serving!
